Idea here is to identify diiferent kinds of SSH Attacks using K-Means Clustering Algorithm. Similar kind of attacks will be clustered together. We also have pcap files for each data points which shows protocols used, kind of packets transferred etc that can easily be looked into Wireshark. After getting the cluster , points belonging to same clusters are compared to find some useful patterns.
