Idea here is to identify diiferent kinds of SSH Attacks using K-Means Clustering Algorithm. Similar kind of attacks will be clustered together. We also have pcap files for each data point which shows protocols used, number and kind of packets transferred etc. that can easily be looked into Wireshark. After getting the clusters , points belonging to the same cluster are compared to find some useful pattern.
